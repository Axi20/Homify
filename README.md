# iSense
iSense is a mobile application written in Java to help users organize their home inventory.

Please note that currently, the app's default language is Hungarian, it is also available in English, but the app is limited to <b>Android</b> users.

There's an APK available for installation on any Android device, allowing users to explore the app.
This application is a personal hobby project aimed at learning the fundamentals of mobile development.
It does have some issues that need attention, as outlined below, but please feel free to give it a try.

<h3>Main functions</h3>
-  Inventory with categories
-  Add items to the inventory
-  Add recipes, with image and categorize them
-  Add items from the inventory to the shopping list
-  Edit or remove items in shopping list page

<h3>Things should/will be improved</h3>
- The style and design accross the whole app
  - The app has been tested on two devices; however, there may be variations in the design on other devices, which need to be addressed.
  - The layout needs to be improve for UX point of view
- The code will require refactoring and better implementations
  - Performance should be improve, it should be more object-oriented and clean
  - Comments should be added/modified

# Features will be implemented in the future
- Support other languages
- Create a minimal limit for items in the inventory
    - if an item reach the given limit, it will be automatically added to the shopping list
- Add different settings, to customize quantities, units, categories, notifications, languages, limits etc.
- Short tutorial for new users
